            Types of exoplanets:
        </h3>
        <p class="exos">
            Hot Jupiters - A class of extrasolar planets whose characteristics are similar to Jupiter, but that have high surface temperatures because they orbit very close—between approximately 0.015 and 0.5 AU (2.2×106 and 74.8×106 km)—to their parent stars, whereas Jupiter orbits its parent star (the Sun) at 5.2 AU (780×106 km), causing low surface temperatures. Hot Jupiters were a big surprise to scientists when they were first discovered since we know that gas giants can only form beyond the frost line (or snow line), a certain distance from the parent star where hydrogen compounds such as water or ammonia have frozen into solid pieces of ice. Inside the frost line planets being formed cannot accumulate these hydrogen compounds because - in the gaseous phase - they are blown away by the stellar winds. Beyond the frost line the hydrogen compounds are condensed, solid pieces that are available for accretion into bigger planets. Hence all hot Jupiters must have formed outside the snow line and subsequently migrated to a closer orbit. This process is not uncommon during the formation of planetary systems. Simulations have shown that migrations of gas giants are not as destructive for the birth of other planets as they might seem. There is a good chance that rocky planets of up to two Earth masses will form in the habitable zone even after the passage of a gas giant in this region of the stellar system.

            Gas Giants - All planets with masses exceeding 10 Earth masses are called gas giants. These planets probably have a small rocky core, but they are mainly composed of hydrogen and helium. We have four gas giants in our own Solar System: Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune (even though Uranus and Neptune might also be categorized as ice giants due to their high water and ammonia content). Since huge gas giants are easier to detect than smaller rocky planets, the first exoplanets to be discovered were all gas giants.
        </p>
        <p class="exos">
            Mini-Neptunes - Also known as a gas dwarf or transitional planet. A planet up to 10 Earth masses, but less massive than Uranus and Neptune. Mini-Neptunes have thick hydrogen–helium atmospheres, probably with deep layers of ice, rock or liquid oceans (made of water, ammonia, a mixture of both, or heavier volatiles).
        </p>
        <p class="exos">
            Super-Earths - An extrasolar planet with a mass higher than Earth's, but substantially below the mass of the Solar System's smaller gas giants Uranus and Neptune, which are 13 and 17 Earth masses respectively. Super-Earths might be even more suitable for life than our own planet Earth - mainly due to their favourable tectonic activity. There are no super-Earths in our own solar system.Super-Earths with a low bulk density are mainly composed of hydrogen and helium; those with higher densities are water-rich (ocean planets) or silicate-rich (rocky planets). After evaluating about 70 super-Earths it turns out that the density increases with the planet's radius up to a value of about 1.5 Earth radii; for larger planets the density rapidly drops. That means that super-Earths of up to 1.5 Earth radii are likely to be ocean planets or rocky planets with a thin atmosphere, still larger planets tend to have a rocky core with a massive and very dense atmosphere; they start to resemble smaller versions of gas giants.
        </p>
        <p class="exos">
            Lava Worlds - A lava planet is a hypothetical type of terrestrial planet with a surface mostly or entirely covered by molten lava.  Situations where such planets could exist include a young terrestrial planet just after its formation, a planet that has recently suffered a large collision event, or a planet orbiting very close to its star, causing intense irradiation and tidal forces.
        </p>
        <p class="exos">
            Rocky planets - As in our own solar system, rocky planets (also called terrestrial planets), are very common in other planetary systems. Rocky planets are mainly composed of heavier elements such as silicon, oxygen or metals. Their solid planetary surface makes them especially suited for harbouring complex life. Most of these planets have a similar structure, caused by the effects of differentiation: immediately after its formation the planet was completely or at least partly molten, thus most of the heavier elements (mainly metals) sink down to the core of the planet and the lighter elements (such as silicon or oxygen) float above the metallic core. After millions of years of cooling the rocky planet is composed of a metallic core and a silicate mantle and crust. This same process of differentiation even works for many of the smaller asteroids.

            Rogue Planets - Rogue planets (also called nomad planets or orphan planets) are planets without a central star; they are free-floating throughout our galaxy. Since there is no star around them they are dark and very difficult to detect. It is estimated that the number of rogue planets in our galaxy exceeds the count of stars,so at least 200 to 400 billion rogue planets are now floating through the Milky Way. Rogue planets come in all sizes from small rocky planets to huge gas giants, but since they are so difficult to detect all the rogue planet candidates discovered up to now (such as, for example, CFBDSIR 2149-0403) have been huge gas giants. They can be directly imaged - especially in infrared - or they can be detected via microlensing. Microlensing causes a background star to appear a tiny bit brighter when a massive object passes in front of it.

        <h3>
            Methods of Exoplanet Detection
        </h3>
        <h4>1. Transit Method</h4>
        <p class="methods">
            The transit method measures the slight drop in brightness when a planet transits in front of the star (as seen from Earth).

            With this method we can only find a minor fraction of the existing exoplanets since the Earth, the exoplanet and its star have to be perfectly aligned in order to observe an exoplanet's transit. For example, the odds of detecting the Earth from any random position outside our solar system with the transit method are just 0.3%, the chance of discovering Mars would be just 0.18%. Nevertheless, space observatory Kepler has continually measured the light curves of 145 000 main sequence stars over a period of several years, finding hundreds of exoplanets using the transit method.

        </figure>
        <p>With the help of the transit method we can not only detect one or more planets in a stellar system, we can also gain other valuable information:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The size of the planet can be estimated by the amount of dimming. Bigger planets cause a stronger drop of the light curve than do smaller planets.</li>
            <li>With the right instruments we can even analyse the atmosphere of the planet. How is this possible? A part of the light from the star passes through the atmosphere of the planet. Different molecules in the atmosphere block specific wavelengths of the star's spectrum. By measuring the so-called transmission spectrum here on Earth we are able to determine the composition of the planet's atmosphere. With the new telescopes that will be operating within the next decade we might even find so called bio-markers, certain molecules that could be a sign of extra-terrestrial life!</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>2. Radial Velocity or Doppler Method</h4>
        <p class="methods">To be very precise: a planet does not orbit around a star as we usually tend to say. The reality is that both the star and the planet orbit around their common centre of mass. Since the star is much more massive than the planet this centre is very close to the star or even inside its volume - but it is never the centre of the star itself. This means a star with planets around it is never completely motionless; it is orbiting around the common centre of mass of the entire stellar system. This wobbling of the star can be observed from Earth with help of the Doppler effect. You all know the Doppler effect since it causes the sound of an approaching object like a car or a train to sound high-pitched (the frequency of the sound waves are higher) and that of a departing object to appear lower (lower sound frequency). This effect works not only for sound waves but also for electromagnetic radiation. During its orbit around the centre of mass, the star moves towards us and away from us, thus the emitted light of the star slightly changes its frequency periodically as seen from Earth. The magnitude and frequency of the wobbling points to the existence, and even the minimum mass, of the planets in orbit around the star.</p>
        <p class="methods">The only exception is if we observe the star directly perpendicular to the plane in which the planets orbit. In this case there is just a wobbling from the left to the right, thus the star is not moving towards or away from us during its orbit. In this case no Doppler effect can be measured here on Earth. Anyhow, not knowing the angle at which we observe the stellar system makes it impossible to precisely determine a planet's mass with the Doppler method; we can just estimate its minimal mass.</p>
